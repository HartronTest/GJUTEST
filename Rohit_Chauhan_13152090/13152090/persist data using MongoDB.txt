type HostName = String

Either a host name e.g., "haskell.org" or a numeric host address string consisting of a dotted decimal IPv4 address or an IPv6 address e.g., "192.168.0.1".

u :: String -> UString

data Action m a

A monad on top of m (which must be a MonadIO) that may access the database and may fail with a DB Failure

data AccessMode

Type of reads and writes to perform

Constructors
ReadStaleOk

UnconfirmedWrites	

Read-write action, slave not OK, every write is fire & forget.
ConfirmWrites GetLastError	

Read-write action, slave not OK, every write is confirmed with getLastError.
